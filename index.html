            Nine women at brunch all order eggs<br>
            benedict. I laugh at how boring my fury.<br>
            This ambition to feel myself closer to an art:<br>
            what distinguishes me from the people<br>
            who order their ribeyes well done.<br>
            I want to tell the rich girls I once had a good life.<br>
            I spoke French and wore my skin tight.<br>
            My Range Rover was green and men touched it.<br>
            Now they ask where I'm from and want me<br>
            to commit some truly Asian acts.<br>
            So I step on a packet of ketchup<br>
            and ruin their weekend chinos.<br>
            Happy as can be to ching chong<br>
            my way out of this interaction.<br>
